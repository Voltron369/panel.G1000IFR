FSX G1000 Panel

This is a free garmin G1000 Panel that works with Microsoft Flight Simulator FSX

Features
* Current Track Indicator on the HSI (Magenta Diamond)
* MFD map is North up

To install, download the zip file here:
https://github.com/Voltron369/panel.G1000IFR/archive/master.zip

copy the g1000 and fs9gps directories to an aircraft panel folder, for example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\FSX\SimObjects\Airplanes\C172\panel.G1000

These will override (but not overwrite) the FSX default G1000 for that aircraft

To uninstall, delete the g1000 and fs9gps directories from that aircraft
